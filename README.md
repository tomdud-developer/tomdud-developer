### About me
I'm a 23-year-old Computer Science student👨‍🎓 at Silesian University of Technology. I also hold an engineering degree📜 in Automatic and Robotic Control from the same institution. For the past three years, I have been immersing myself in the world of programming, with a particular focus on java_iconJava backend development, but as well as some exposure to React.js. While I started my programming journey with C++, it wasn't long before I fell in love with ❤️java_iconJava. Currently, I'm honing my skills in Java microservices architecture and working on personal projects to further develop my abilities. My technology stack includes java_iconJava, along with various tools and frameworks used in backend microservices development. I'm passionate about building scalable and efficient software solutions, and I'm always seeking out new challenges to help me expand my knowledge and expertise.

### My plans
I am currently 🔎looking for an internship for the position of Junior Java Backend Developer. I feel that is a good moment to start my IT career, because it's the perfect way to take it my programming to the next ⭐level. In the near future, my goal is to become an expert in backend development, with a strong focus on mastering microservices, cloud technology, and Kubernetes. I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas to develop efficient and scalable applications.
